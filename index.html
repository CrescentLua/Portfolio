        Hey there! My name is John, and I am a gameplay programmer from Toronto, Ontario. 
        I have been making games ever since I was 14 and published my first successful game on Roblox when I was 17. 
        I am currently pursuing an advanced diploma at Humber college studying Game Programming under the faculty of Media & Creative Arts. 

        Throughout my portfolio you will be able to see projects that Iâ€™ve personally worked on, alongside some of my side projects. 
        I have a huge passion for learning so I often find myself constantly trying to learn new things that are often challenging, 
        while also continuing to strengthen my current technical abilities. 
        
        My newest hobby is to make small websites (like this :D) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
